## Introduction

The Ubuntu OS Dockerfile provides a script for building a Docker image that is based on the Ubuntu operating system. This Dockerfile serves as a blueprint to create a containerized environment tailored to your needs.

## Features

- **Ubuntu Base**: The Dockerfile starts from an official Ubuntu base image.
- **Customizable**: Modify the Dockerfile to install additional software and configure the environment.
- **Versioned**: Easily maintain different versions of your customized Ubuntu image.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Docker installed. You can download it from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/).

### Building the Image

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ubuntu-dockerfile.git
   cd ubuntu-dockerfile

2. Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:

	docker build -t my-ubuntu-image .

## Usage

### Running a Container

To run a container based on the Ubuntu Docker image you built, use the following command:
docker run -it my-ubuntu-image
This command will start an interactive shell session within the container. You can exit the container by typing exit.

## Customization

1.Installing Packages: Inside the Dockerfile, you can use RUN commands to install packages using apt. For example 
RUN 
   sh
   apt update && apt install -y <package-name>

2.Configuration: Customize the environment by adding configuration files or scripts to the Dockerfile.
